# Financing extension

Adds fields to disclose the financing of the whole process and its individual contracts.

Sometimes, particularly in the case of Public Private Partnerships, contracts are financed using a range of instruments, including loans, grants, share issues and so-on. This information can be updated over the lifetime of the contract.

## Legal context

In the European Union, this extension's fields correspond to [eForms BG-611 (Contract EU funds) and BG-61 (EU funds)](https://github.com/eForms/eForms). See [OCDS for the European Union](http://standard.open-contracting.org/profiles/eu/master/en/) for the correspondences to Tenders Electronic Daily (TED).
